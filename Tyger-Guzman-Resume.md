## Summary

Software Engineer & Security Specialist with a 20-year history of turning complex data into actionable enterprise intelligence. At USAA, I bridge technical architecture and business value—engineering solutions across full-stack development, automated fraud detection, and adversarial AI research.

### THE PROFESSIONAL ARC: 20 YEARS OF TELEMETRY

My career is defined by technical evolution and solving "impossible" data problems:

- **The Foundation:** Mastered enterprise automation—engineering VBA-based tools for 1,000+ agents at Pace and real-time workforce analytics at Medtronic.
- **The Scale:** At Mphasis, led technical data reconciliation for a major global logistics M&A (FedEx), using TIBCO Data Virtualization to sync global datasets.

This veteran perspective drives a Systems-First mindset ensuring long-term stability, security, and member trust in Cloud and AI engineering.

### CORE ENGINEERING AT USAA

I drive innovation across three domains to protect the membership and modernize the enterprise:

- **Security Awareness:** Modernizing data pipelines using Python, Docker, and Kubernetes (K8s) via GitLab CI/CD to scale security telemetry.
- **Identity Management (MIAM):** Developing secure portals using React and Java Spring Boot to manage identity preferences for millions of members.
- **Internal Fraud Monitoring:** Engineering automated surveillance models by processing millions of transactions through SAS Fraud Detection and IBM DataStage.

### AI RESEARCH & ADVERSARIAL FORENSICS

AI-Ready focus on generative system security and Human-in-the-Loop safety for enterprise adoption:

- **Adversarial Auditing:** Forensic audits of Attention Mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities like Instruction Hierarchy Inversion and bypass risks.
- **NIST Alignment:** Mapping findings to the NIST AI RMF 1.0 (Govern, Map, Manage) to create defensible AI governance frameworks.
- **Infrastructure:** Engineering bare-metal Linux environments with hardware-accelerated CUDA for secure, local model inference.

### TECHNICAL TOOLKIT

- **Languages:** Python, Java Spring Boot, React, JavaScript, SQL, VBA, SAS
- **Data Architecture:** TIBCO (TDV/Spotfire), IBM DataStage, Snowflake, Oracle, DB2
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, Linux (Pop!OS/Ubuntu)

Analytical by nature, business-focused in practice. Whether analyzing fraud or building next-gen AI tools, I always ask: what decision does this enable? I thrive between technical possibility and business value.
