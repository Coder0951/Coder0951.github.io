# Knowledge Engineering: Persona-Based Career Logic & Dossier Synthesis

Feb 2026 - Feb 2026Feb 2026 - Feb 2026

## Objective:
Engineered a high-fidelity Knowledge Management system to audit and synthesize years of professional data. Developed a modular Persona-Based Logic framework to eliminate hallucination and ensure absolute data integrity during the construction of a comprehensive professional dossier.

## Technical Architecture & Methodology:
- Multi-Tier Persona Orchestration (L1–L6):
 * L1 The Archivist Extract raw facts without adding narrative or "fluff."
 * L2 The Analyst Cross-reference L1 facts with industry-standard technical stacks.
 * L3 The Engineer Translate professional history into specific "Proof of Work" artifacts.
 * L4 The Auditor Check for hallucinations; ensure no "AI-isms" or false claims exist.
 * L5 The Strategist Align the data with the career trajectory of a Senior AI/ML Leader.
 * L6 The Editor Finalize the tone for "Executive-Level" signaling and clarity.

## Data Modeling & Logic Anchors:
 * Developed Contextual Anchors to prevent the model from drifting into probabilistic guesses.
 * Implemented an iterative verification loop where each persona audits the previous one's output for factual alignment.
 * Mapped years of technical growth to current industry frameworks.

## Strategic Dossier Synthesis:
 * Transformed unstructured historical logs into structured forensic reports and technical project entries.
 * Optimized the narrative for Impact-First signaling, ensuring 100% alignment with real-world professional outcomes.
 * Engineered the Strategic Career Logic framework used to derive technical project descriptions from archival data.

# Technical Results:
### Zero-Hallucination Output:
* Achieved absolute factual accuracy across years of reconstructed career history.
### Modular Scalability: 
* Developed a reusable persona-based prompt architecture for complex document synthesis.
* Strategic Alignment: Successfully mapped 40,000+ words of raw history into high-density technical Proof of Work artifacts.
