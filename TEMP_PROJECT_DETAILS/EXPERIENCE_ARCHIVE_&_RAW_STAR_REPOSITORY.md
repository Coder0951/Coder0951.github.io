### **II. CHRONOLOGICAL REPOSITORY (ABSOLUTE VERBATIM)**

#### **USAA | INTERNAL FRAUD MONITORING**

* **The Mission:** "The INTERNAL FRAUD MONITORING team, we monitor and detect internal fraud."
* **The Tech Stack:** "Team two we also need to add on that we do some database architecture as we own our own database and have to get all of our table Creations approved by a data modeler and also our ETL work is done with IBM data stated cannot be left out."
* **The CRM:** "Salesforce is the CRM system that is used for internal fraud monitoring."
* **The Database Constraint:** "Don't make so much a big deal about the database ownership its a single database."

#### **USAA | MEMBER IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT (MIAM)**

* **The Scope:** "Team 3 it's member identity access management and the member facing portal that I was specifically working on was the security preference portal."
* **Internal CRM Development:** "Engineered a separate, distinct internal CRM front-end for Service Reps to manage member identity preferences internally."

#### **USAA | JIRA ANALYTICS POC (GENAI)**

* **The Scale:** "I did take all of our Jura stories for an entire quarter and had it run through an llm that gave out a multi-page review that gave a breakdown of all the features stories points and other metadata from the jira export."
* **The Impact:** "This jira AI processing thing that I created was the proof of concept for a small team and then was presented to a director for potential to be picked up and funded it was kind of a side project least got the attention of my boss and his boss."

#### **MPHASIS (FEDEX M&A)**

* **The Problem:** "I was given two flat files... one from FedEx and also from the acquisition company and I had to put them into a database to find where the duplicates were so that way it could be reconciled by a team."
* **The Solution:** "I created a interactive tipco Spotfire dashboard that acted as a dashboard and a CRM system to write and read to the database."
* **Executive Use:** "Executive Intelligence Dashboards at mphasis for the merger."

#### **MEDTRONIC DIABETES**

* **The Primary Function:** "Executive Intelligence Dashboards at medtronic... integrated Cisco CUIC telephony data for real-time workforce monitoring. This was a primary function of the role."
* **Sentiment/Voice recognition:** "Sentiment Analysis voice recognition. Integrated Verint Voice Recognition to track sentiment triggers (Acoustic Pattern Recognition) to detect and mitigate agent fatigue... spot agent fatigue when they would use negative words such as 'you're not listening to me' 'you dont understand' spoken by the representative signaling a burnout."
* **Vendor Liaison:** "I was able to work with the vendors and get a clear understanding of what the software's capability was to translate that to the business partners along with being able to put in the configurations into the software for it to sync up with our telephony system."

#### **PACE**

* **The Automation:** "To eliminate manual error in agent skill resets, I leveraged Avaya VBA objects to create a tool that reset the entire center to default skills every night."
* **The SendKeys Hack:** "utilized SendKeys for bulk renaming of agent IDs, saving significant analyst hours."
* **The VoIP/IPTV Support:** "Tier 2 support for VoIP/IPTV. Identified regional outages by correlating call patterns before official vendor alerts triggered."

#### **VALERO ENERGY CORP**

* **The Altercation:** "A associate of a store i was watching had a huge verbal altercation with me as she was displaying visble frustration in front of customers and when asked to speak to her in the back she blew up screaming not my manager. It would not de escalate and ended up sending her home immediately and gave two days unpaid leave."
* **The Turnaround:** "We level set came to an understanding of mutual respect by allowing cool down period and allowing the associate to be heard... they later would become one of the best workers."
* **The Floating Manager Struggle:** "Not having a permanent store for almost 1.5 years was a tough people management with sometimes such little time to build the team relationship."

### **IV. ADVERSARIAL FORENSIC RESEARCH & AI INFRASTRUCTURE**

#### **Forensic Audit & NIST Mapping**

* **The Volume:** "Conducted a 467-message forensic audit to identify deterministic control failures."
* **The Theoretical Discovery:** "Induced a persistent Instruction Hierarchy Inversion by weaponizing the Attention Mechanism to bypass system-level safety guardrails."
* **The NIST Link:** "Mapped findings to the NIST AI RMF 1.0... Specific failures identified in: GOVERN, MAP, and MANAGE functions."

#### **Python Image Integrity Pipeline**

* **The Offline Requirement:** "Developed a raw Python pipeline (offline, no UI tools) to solve 'closed eyes' in photography using facial recognition mapping and precision masking."
* **The Seed Stability:** "Engineered a Python-based synthetic data generator to maintain character persistence (seed-stability) across thousands of variations for model training."

#### **Custom Hardware**

* **The Build:** "Built a dedicated high-performance PC with a dedicated graphics card for local AI/ML inference. Configured a bare-metal Linux environment (Pop!OS) with complex CUDA toolkit integration."

### **V. KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING & LLM ORCHESTRATION**

* **The Dossier Objective:** "Engineered a persistent, zero-hallucination career data model... bridging 20 years of professional telemetry with 100% representation accuracy."
